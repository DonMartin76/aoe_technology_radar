Different approaches for Voice Interfaces are under developement. SmartSteuer and Haufe offers already live Skills in the Skill Store from Amazon.

## Why? ##

„Amazon kills the buy button“ was maybe one of the most inspiring headlines I heard during last years conferences. But with the massive push of Alexa since the introduction, especially around holiday season last year, Amazon brought Voice Interfaces to a broad audience. And guess what: Alexa has no buy button!

But not only Amazon invests heavily in Voice. All the big players are in the game. Google‘s Assistant, IBM’s Watson, Apple‘s Siri or Microsoft’s Cortana. Nearly all of the tech-giants has its own assistant. In case of Amazon and Microsoft they even go futher and announced last year a cooperation between their two AI’s, as well as Salesforce did with IBM.

And the story goes on: If you look at last years CES or IFA, for example, integrated voice solutions were one of the major topics. Speakers, Refigerators and of course, cars. All will come with a voice interface.

And all this is shaping the future and expecations of our customers.

- “50% of all searches will be voice searches by 2020” according to comscore https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/just-say-it-future-search-voice-personal-digital-assistants/1392459 

- “About 30% of searches will be done without a screen by 2020.” via Mediapos https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/291913/gartner-predicts-30-of-searches-without-a-screen.html

- “We estimate there will be 21.4 million smart speakers in the US by 2020” according to Activate https://www.slideshare.net/ActivateInc/think-again-tech-media-outlook-2017-67604099


The battle of the platforms just began. While especially Amazon https://developer.amazon.com/de/alexa-skills-kit  and Google https://developers.google.com/actions/ offers broad support to build Skills (Amazon) or Actions (Google), the other companys are scarce in public information. As Amazon surely dominates the  Hardware, Google has with Android the major mobile OS with voice access. Meanwhile IBM and Salesforce build an alternative superpower in terms of business solutions.

And it’s just the beginning: Amazon is heading now for „Business“. With Alexa for Business

they offer a complete infrastructure clients can use for Business reasons. Combined with AWS it‘s more powerfuld than ever. 

Besides the Tech Giants and their solutions also new players pop up in the market, like e. g. the open source voice assistant from mycroft: https://mycroft.ai/ 

Or look at Cisco’s Spark:

But nevertheless, Voice also has it’s tricky side:

Besides this funny aspects, Voice Interfaces confront especially HG with real challenges. Branding for example. If screens doesn‘t exist anymore, what defines the brand than? What kind of „personality“ we want to be? Or the products. How a service, tool, app should look & feel like with voice? Online shops? If voice kills the buy button, how we gonna sell than? Or Lead Generation? What happens to Search, Online Media or E-Mail? 

Psychology, Data, Economics, Content, Creativity … here disciplines really mix up for a great experience.

Well, good news. People will search forever, and keep on buying stuff online. But the game changes, and it changes quickly. How we will take action?

Highly recommended regrading Voice:

So it’s time, to get it on!
