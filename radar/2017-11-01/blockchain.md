## Why? ##

The Blockchain technology is hard to grasp and understand. It is very interesting for us because there are a lot of possible opportunities that fits to our business.
The most popular Blockchain solution is the cryptocurrency [bitcoin](https://www.bitcoin.com/).

But there is much more that is addressed by Blockchain technology:

- Smart Contracts
- Micropayments
- Digital rights management
- Supply chain auditing

Possible business ideas for us might be

- Store education data like education experiences, certificates

### What is Blockchain? ###

A Blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all digital (often cryptocurrency) transactions. It allows market participants to keep track of digital transactions without central record keeping or authority. The Blockchain is immutable. You cannot change the entries. You can only add entries. The Blockchain is unhackable.

> “The Blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just
> financial transactions but virtually everything of value.”
Don & Alex Tapscott, authors Blockchain Revolution (2016)
