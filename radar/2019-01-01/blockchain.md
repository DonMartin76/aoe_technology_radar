On 14 May, The Haufe Group Network had its first offline event, **Blockchain Lab**, to explore possibilities of using distributed ledger technologies (Blockchain technology) for Haufe Group products. It was a business driven workshop where we discussed and analyzed ideas from seven teams.   
You can find a more information about the **Blockchain Lab** [here](http://work.haufegroup.io/blockchainlab_with_codecetnric/) in our Dev Blog.

To be honest not many of those ideas could convince and did promise business value.

The idea that we push is to create an [Openbadge](https://openbadges.org/) service for education certificates.
You can contact Markus Lobreyer <markus.lobreyer@haufe-lexware.com> for more information.   
In a second step it is planned combine Open Badges with the Blockchain. Read the following [article](https://draftin.com/documents/1138961?token=hQ5q0mCHizZum8-pkDFYUZr4YFYOWMN01BPT-5uX00hAaGxYOAlgAlhyenat76hjNpTCs-CMWPI38KWn_omp0Oc) for more information.
